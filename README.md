📈 RD Algo TerminalA sophisticated, full-stack algorithmic trading platform designed for Zerodha (Kite Connect). It bridges the gap between manual discretionary trading and automated risk management, featuring a mobile-responsive dashboard, background risk engine, and seamless switching between Live, Paper, and Simulation modes.🌟 Key Features1. 🔐 Automated AuthenticationAuto-Login: Uses Selenium & Chrome Headless to bypass the manual login process.TOTP Handling: Automatically generates and submits Time-based OTPs using pyotp.Resilience: Detects session expiry and attempts auto-reconnection in the background.Secure Admin Mode: Fallback manual login route (/secure) protected by an admin password.2. 🛡️ Advanced Risk EngineThe core of the system runs on a background thread (strategy_manager.py), ensuring your trades are protected even if you close the browser.Stop Loss (SL): Supports fixed point-based SL or specific price SL.Target Management: Configurable T1, T2, T3 targets with "Partial Exit" (Lot-based) or "Full Exit" logic.Trailing Stop Loss:Step Trailing: Moves SL in fixed steps (e.g., if price moves up 20, SL moves up 20).Auto-Match Entry (-1 Logic): Setting Trailing SL to -1 automatically sets the trail gap equal to your initial SL risk.Trail Limits: Cap the trailing SL to Entry, Target 1, Target 2, etc.Exit Multiplier: Automatically splits large quantities into smaller chunks to distribute targets evenly.3. 🚀 Trading ModesLIVE Mode: Real money execution via Kite API. Syncs Broker SL orders with internal logic.PAPER Mode: Virtual trading to test strategies without financial risk. Tracks P&L realistically.SIMULATION (God Mode): A standalone simulation environment (run_demo.py) where you control market prices, volatility, and trends to stress-test the UI and risk logic.4. 💻 Interactive DashboardReal-time Ticker: Live NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, and SENSEX updates.Option Chain: Dynamic fetching of strikes and expiries for indices and stocks.Position Management: "One-click" Edit Trade, Add Lots (Averaging), or Partial Exit.History & Analytics: Detailed trade logs, "Potential Profit" tracker (shows missed moves), and daily P&L summary.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureBackend: Python Flask (Web Server), Gunicorn (Production Server).Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, jQuery (AJAX-based polling for real-time feel).Database: SQLAlchemy ORM (SQLite/PostgreSQL) storing JSON blobs for flexibility.Broker Integration: kiteconnect (Official API) + selenium (Login Automation).Containerization: Docker support with Google Chrome installed for the scraper.⚙️ Configuration (.env)Create a .env file (or set environment variables) with the following credentials:VariableDescriptionAPI_KEYZerodha Kite Connect API KeyAPI_SECRETZerodha Kite Connect API SecretZERODHA_USER_IDYour Zerodha Client ID (e.g., AB1234)ZERODHA_PASSWORDYour Zerodha PasswordTOTP_SECRETThe TOTP Secret Key (from Zerodha 2FA settings)ADMIN_PASSWORDPassword to access the /secure manual login pageDATABASE_URL(Optional) DB Connection string.

🕹️ User Guide1. Placing a TradeWatchlist: Select a symbol or type (e.g., NIFTY) and click +.Instrument: Select Type (CE/PE/FUT), Expiry, and Strike.Quantity: Use the + / - buttons to adjust lots.Protection:SL Points: Auto-calculates SL Price.Targets: Enable T1/T2/T3 and define exit lots (check F for Full Exit).Trailing: Enter points or -1 to match SL points.Execute: Click LIVE (Red) or PAPER (Yellow) button to set mode, then click EXECUTE.2. Managing PositionsGo to the Active tab:Edit: Change SL, Targets, or Trailing logic on the fly.Manage Lots: Click Edit -> Use "Add Lots" (Buy) or "Exit Lots" (Sell) for quick adjustments.Logs: Click "Logs" to see the decision timeline (Entry time, Trailing movements, Broker order IDs).3. Global SettingsClick ⚙️ Settings in the top right:General: Enable/Disable exchanges for search (NSE, NFO, MCX, etc.).Mode Config: Set default Quantity Multipliers, Risk Ratios (1:1, 1:2), and Bulk SL Points for specific symbols.🗄️ Database SchemaThe system uses database.py with SQLAlchemy. Data is stored as JSON strings for flexibility.ActiveTrade (active_trade)id: Timestamp-based unique ID.data: JSON object containing:symbol, mode (LIVE/PAPER), quantity, entry_price.sl, targets (list), trailing_sl.sl_order_id (Broker Order ID for SL-M).logs (Array of events).TradeHistory (trade_history)id: Trade ID.data: Same as ActiveTrade but with exit_price, pnl, exit_reason (SL_HIT, TARGET_HIT).AppSetting (app_setting)Stores global configuration (Watchlists, Default Ratios, Bulk SL settings).⚠️ DisclaimerThis software is for educational purposes only. Algorithmic trading involves significant financial risk. The logic provided here (Auto-login, SL management) depends on third-party platforms (Zerodha) and internet connectivity.
